# Eric Kleppe Homework 6 WeatherPy 

Analyzing weather data for over 500 cities across the globe, we can see a few trends:

Temperatures are warmer in cities closer to the equator. Looking at the scatter plot, City Latitude vs. Max Temperature, you will notice the plotted points form a curve with majority of the highest temperatures plotted between the latitude range of -20 to 20. 

There might be a weak relationship between city latitude and wind speed. Looking at the scatter plot, City Latitude vs. Wind Speed, wind speeds over 20 miles per hour become less rare in cities outside of the latitude range -20 to 20. 

There is a relationship between city latitude and humidity. Looking at scatter plot, City Latitude vs. Humidity, there are few cities with humidity below 60% between latitude range of -20 to 0. This suggests cities closer to the equator are more humid overall; however, there doesn't appear to be any affect on the cloudiness of the city regardless of the latitude and humidity.
